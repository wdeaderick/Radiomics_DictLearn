# A Visually-Interpretable, Dictionary-Based Approach to Radiogenomics

This repo contains code for the experiments in the 2018 paper *A Visually-Interpretable, Dictionary-Based Approach to Imaging-Genomic Modeling, with Low-Grade Glioma as a Case Study.* 
 
## Requirements

All exeriments are written in the MATLAB programming and require [VLFeat](http://www.vlfeat.org/overview/hog.html) for representation extraction and [DICTOL](https://github.com/tiepvupsu/DICTOL) for dictionary learning.

## Execution

To perform the experiments, one must only run
